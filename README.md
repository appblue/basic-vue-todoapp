# Basic Vue.js TODO Application

This application has been created by loosly following YT video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wy9q22isx3U), and the whole purpose was learning Vue.js, not web design, so you will not find whisles and bells here when it comes to UX.

One departure from the original video is usage of `vue-uuid` instead of `uuid` npm package, as `uuid` didn't wanted to cooperate with the latest version of Vue.js.

## Project setup
